i do not support the ftp to store/mods/mods name method with this mod.

It can be done but it is a bad method and it breaks the mod for any extra prosilveR based style it
applied to (1.0.4 & 1.1.3)


RECOMMENDED WAY TO UPDATE

Remove the old mod via automod and install 1.1.8

2ND RECOMMENDED WAY TO UPDATE (Stand alone)

In the root folder of this mod is a file named:

install_mod.xml

delete this file 

Then select the needed update file from this folder and copy and
paste it into the root of this mod, for example:

install_mod(update 1.1.3 to 1.1.8).xml

and rename it to 

install_mod.xml

re ZIP the mod and then upload it as a stand alone mod.

Install this stand alone as a new mod.

Apply to any styles as needed (will update any prosilver based styles)

REASONS?

Easily updates previous mods with new features

Properly edits subsilver on install

Applies proper updates to extra styles already with the older mod

Can be totally removed via automod reverting the updated mod to its previous state

This older mod can then be removed properly via automod.

much cleaner process overall.
