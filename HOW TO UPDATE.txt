i do not support the ftp to store/mods/mods name method with this mod.

It can be done but it is a bad method and it breaks the mod for any extra prosilveR based style it
applied to (1.0.4 & 1.1.3)



RECOMMENDED WAY TO UPDATE (Stand alone)

In the same folder as this readme is the core install file named

install_mod(1.1.8).xml

delete this file and all files up to your required update file

you can delete them all except teh one you want also.

once you have the right file elft, for example

install_mod(update 1.1.3 to 1.1.8).xml


re ZIP the mod and then upload it as a stand alone mod.

Install this stand alone as a new mod.

Apply to any styles as needed (will update any prosilver based styles)


REASONS?

Easily updates previous mods with new features

Properly edits subsilver on install

Applies proper updates to extra styles already with the older mod

Can be totally removed via automod reverting the updated mod to its previous state

This older mod can then be removed properly via automod.

much cleaner process overall.
